# HTML-CSS-JS
As a web developer, the three main languages we use to build websites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is the programming language, we use HTML to structure the site, and we use CSS to design and layout the web page. These days, CSS has become more than just a design language, though.

<h1>HTML</h1>
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

<h1>CSS</h1>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

<h1>JavaScript</h1>
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
